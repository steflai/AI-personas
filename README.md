# K means AI-personas
Using unsupervised ML (Kmeans) to cluster data + qualitative lens to create personas as typically seen as part of marketing strategy 

Idea is for algorithm to spot commonalities based on any given criteria and form groups according to that. The rest of the data is then examined to round out the profiles of each group. 

As a fun touch I've used generative AI to try to create a 'voice' for each persona based on text data included in the dataset.
